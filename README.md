## How to Use

ResolutionSwitcher is a samll utility to change between difference screen resolutions, orientation and scale factors. 

I developed it because I had to test applications for target machines of different resolutions, and repeatly change it in system settings tend to be slow and inefficient.

This program hide to system tray on startup. You can right-click tray icon to show settings menu, from where custom resolution modes can be defined and sorted.

After perfered screen mode defined, you can either right-click or double-click tray icon to choose from available screen modes. Changes are applied at once.

The program can be compiled to both 32 & 64 bit. However, I'd only tested builds for 64-bit, because 32-bit machine are rarely used today.
